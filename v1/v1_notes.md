This is the basic jist of it, I'd suggest using POSTMAN to test out the API's. Everything should work fine as it did for me.

Run your Spring Boot Application, then type in localhost address to postman to test out CRUD operations.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions, or add on to this if you like.
